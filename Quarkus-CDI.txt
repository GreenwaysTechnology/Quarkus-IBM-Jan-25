			    Dependency Injection - IOC
.....................................................................................
What is IOC?
 Inversion of Control is design pattern for creating dependent objects and injecting into another.

How IOC is implemented in Spring?
 Spring Container is the reference implementation of IOC design pattern

How IOC is implemented in Quarkus?
  Quarkus uses JEE spec called CDI - context Dependency Injection

Quarkus and CDI ?
 Quarkus has not implemented 100% CDI spec due to some reasons.

"Quarkus ArC" is a build-time oriented dependency injection based on CDI 2.0.

Spring and JEE dependencies are resolved "during runtime" only

Quarkus dependencies are resolved "During build time".


Spring:

interface A{ }

class A1 implements A{}

class B1 implements A{}

class C {
  A a;  =  new A1 or B1
}

Which implementation is picked up and when the implementation is decided. - during runtime -

  Dependencies are resolved during runtime -spring
  Dependencies are resolved build runtime -Quarkus

JEE CDI(Spring CDI) Vs Quarkus CDI:
......................

JEE CDI "resolves" bean dependency during runtime of an application, after deployment, if something goes wrong, errors are reported only during runtime.

Quarkus CDI uses a model called "Build Time"

   During application build process, if there is any dependency mismatch related errors are reported.

Build-time Processing Benefits and Drawbacks:
..............................................

Fail Fast
  Beans and dependencies are validated during the build so that your application can never fail in production with common problems such as AmbiguousResolutionException or UnsatisfiedResolutionException.

Instant Startup
  When the app starts ArC just loads all the metadata and initializes some internal structures. There is no need to analyze the application classes again. This means negligible startup overhead.
 
Optimized Code Paths and Metadata Structures

  When generating the metadata classes ArC can sometimes produce leaner and smarter logic because it has the whole application analyzed already.

				Core Features of CDI:

1.Bean: What is Bean?

Bean is java object

Types of Beans:

1.Application Beans(pojos)
   Objects are created by developer 
   Objects life cycle is managed by developer and JVM

2.Container managed Bean
   Objects created by the Container

What is container?
   Container is runtime where Quarkus apps are running.
   Object life cycle are managed by Runtime 

What are the advantages of Container Managed Bean?

>The developer can focus application logic.

			 CDI implementation
...................................................................................

CDI is implemented via "Annotations"


Apis in cdi:

1.jakarta.inject
2.jakarta.enterprise.inject - core di apis
3.jakarta.enterprise.context - scope and contextuaal apis
4.jakarta.enterprise.events -  publishing events and listening events-  container wide event driven programming
5.jakarta.enterprise.util
6.jakarta.interceptor

Common Annotations:

1.@Inject  
2.@Qualifer
3.LifeCycle of Bean
   @ApplicationScoped =@component,@Bean,@Service......
   @SessionScoped
   @RequestScoped
   @SingleTon

ApplicationScoped vs SingleTon
 Both are same - single instance across the application
 but SingleTon beans not available inside testing env..
 
4.@Observes - event listener - StartupEvent

...................................................................................
			Quarkus Application Architecture
...................................................................................

There are two layers

1.controllers -Resources
   Using Rest api
2.services
   Using plain java class called services...


Steps:
1.create Quarkus app for CDI

quarkus create app cdi-app

Use case: Without CDI , how to create bean and use

package com.ibm.cdi.services;

import java.util.List;

public class UserService {

    public List<String> users(){
        return List.of("Subramanian","Murugan");
    }
}
package com.ibm.cdi.controller;

import com.ibm.cdi.services.UserService;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import java.util.List;

@Path("users")
public class UserResource {
    UserService userService = new UserService();

    @GET
    public List<String> users() {
        return userService.users();
    }
}

The class "UserService" is called Bean class- Application Bean- we have to create instance of this class.

Quarkus recommends to apply "IOC" principle: Dont create object by yourself. ask the container to create and manage- just use create object : Container Managed Bean


Service class need to be annotated using the following any one of the annotations

@ApplicationScoped
@SingleTon

These annotations marks the class , so that the container creates object automatically and make it available ready for use.


package com.ibm.cdi.services;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import java.util.List;

@ApplicationScoped
public class UserService {

    public List<String> users() {
        return List.of("Subramanian", "Murugan");
    }
}



package com.ibm.cdi.controller;

import com.ibm.cdi.services.UserService;
import io.vertx.ext.auth.User;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import java.util.List;

@Path("users")
public class UserResource {
  //  UserService userService = new UserService();
    @Inject
    private UserService userService;

    @GET
    public List<String> users() {
        return userService.users();
    }
}

Task: Already we have written ItemResource class with curd inside resources , now separate the logic into ItemService class.
